Title:Projects

These are the projects I've worked on in my free time.  If you'd like a more comprehensive list, including projects I've 
worked on in a professional setting, check out my [resume](/theme/files/PrashanDharmasenaResume.pdf) or my [GitHub](http://github.com/qrazhan).

- [BearCheck](http://bearcheck.herokuapp.com) - a system for UC Berkeley students to be notified when a seat opens up in 
classes they want.
- [out4lunch](http://out4lunch.tumblr.com) - a restaurant review blog that I help maintain with a few of my high school friends.
