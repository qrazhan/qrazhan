Title:About Me

Hi! I'm Prashan.
----------------

I'm a Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley and an alumnus of the 
MBHS Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet Program.  I was born in Washington, DC and raised in Rockville, MD, 
so I guess you could say I'm an east coast kid.  But, I'm definitely looking forward to the next four years on the west coast.
