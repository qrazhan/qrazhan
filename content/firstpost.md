Title:My Own Website, Finally
Date:2013-08-10

A New Beginning
---------------

After four years of telling myself that I'd build my own website, I've finally done it.  I figured that now would be a great time since I'm not only going away to college, but across the country as well.  Plus, it doesn't hurt that I have some programming projects to show off as well.  

This site will be a place for me to share my experiences at Cal, my programming endeavours, and whatever else may come to mind.  Though, given my Facebook posting habits (or lack thereof), I guess only time will tell how often this website gets updated.  Hopefully, having this site will encourage me to write more and help me become a better writer.

Building the site
-----------------

For those of you that are more technically-inclined, this website is created through a static-site generator called [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com), a Python equivalent to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  I found it very easy to use and I love that it lets me write all my content in Markdown.  The theme is of my own design, but inspired by [svbtle](http://svbtle.com) and built upon the unstyled "simple" theme that comes with Pelican.  Feel free to check out both the [theme]() and website [source]() on my [GitHub](http://github.com/qrazhan).
