    <h2>My First Two Weeks at Cal</h2>
<p><img class="img-horz-center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31446677/bigcsunset.jpg"/></p>
<p>College. Is. Awesome.  Or maybe I'm still in the honeymoon period where everything just feels like sleep-away summer camp.  Nonetheless, I've made a ton of new friends (Clark Kerr Building #7 Floor 1!) and my roommates, Stephen and Mark, are pretty chill.  Our room is pretty awesome; we have a dartboard and a nice monitor to watch movies on.  It helps that our room can fit most of the floor too (though it isn't as big as the triples on the third floor =( ).  I'd put up a picture, but I forgot to take one after we moved things around and let's be honest -- after two weeks it's pretty messy.  The weather here is amazing as well, always sunny but nowhere near as humid as Maryland.  The only thing I wish I could change is the walking.  The dorm complex I live in, Clark Kerr Campus, is about a mile from my closest class.  And then there are the hills.  Walking to class isn't too bad, but the walk back home is all uphill.  Even the walk from the lower part of campus to some of the CS buildings is pretty steep.  At least I'll fend off freshman 15 pretty easily.  </p>
<p><img class="img-vert-center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31446677/downtothebay.jpg"/></p>
<p>I spent a lot of this week exploring campus: hiking up to the Big C, going up to the top of the Campanile, and even going up the fire trails behind campus at 3am.  Campus is so beautiful.  From the base of the Campanile, you can see all the way down to the bay.  You can even see the Golden Gate Bridge way off in the distance.  The view from the top of the Campanile is also pretty amazing, you can see all of campus: from Memorial Glade to Haas/Memorial Stadium.  You can see some more of my pictures <a href="https://www.facebook.com/prashan.dharmasena/media_set?set=a.626061877444161.1073741827.100001210623966&amp;type=3">here.</a></p>
<p><img class="img-horz-center" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31446677/calfootball.jpg"/></p>
<p>I also went to my first college football game: Cal vs Northwestern.  I'm not really into football, but I have to say, being in the student section at a college football game is amazing.  The amount of energy is ridiculous, especially in such a close game.  The two teams seemed fairly even, and our new quarterback is pretty beast.  There were some crazy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx_yrgks7g">interceptions</a> and some insane touchdown <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiPwumWallU">plays</a>.  Plus, its nice to stand in the stadium where all my out-of-state tuition fees are going.  That being said, I sold my ticket to yesterday's Portland State game for $15 and I'm hoping to sell my Ohio State ticket for $50+.  I'll definitely be going to the USC game, though.  I might even go the Big Game at Stanford this year!</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p><img class="img-keep-size" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31446677/schedule.png"/></p>
<p>For those of you who are interested, this is my schedule for this semester:</p>
<p><strong>CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</strong><br />
The intro CS class here. Unfortunately the CS department doesn't let people skip this class, so I'm stuck taking it.  On the upside, it's an incredibly easy A and since theres 1100 students (lecture hall only seats 700) class is optional and everything is posted online.</p>
<p><strong>Math 54: Linear Algebra and Diff Eqs</strong><br />
Since Multi-Var isn't required for my major and I've already taken Walstein's class, I'm taking Lin Alg this semester.  My professor's lecturing is like a machine gun and if you space out for 5 minutes you can't understand the rest of the lecture.  But, my GSI (the fancy Berkeley term for TA) is pretty good and the textbook is fairly straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Classics 10A: Intro to Greek Civilization</strong><br />
A class I'm taking to satisfy one of my breadth requirements.  I actually find it pretty interesting, especially since I've always loved Greek mythology.  The book list is fairly long, 10 books, but the class seems to be going at a reasonable pace.</p>
<p><strong>IEOR 190C: Big Data Industry Challenge</strong>  <br />
This is by far my coolest class, and not because it's held in a penthouse. This class is essentially the college version of Software Design.  Basically, the class is split into teams of five to emulate startups. We compete against eachother and at the end of the semester the winning team gets a $10,000 prize.  (IEOR stands for Industrial Engineering and Operations Research)</p>
<p><strong>Archery Decal</strong><br />
At Berkeley, we have student-run courses called <a href="http://www.decal.org">"decals"</a> and they range from fun classes such as "Pokemon Academy" and "The Wonderful Wizarding World of Harry Potter" to more practical classes such as "Introduction to Wall Street" and, of course, "League of Legends Game Theory."  As you can probably tell, the decal I'm taking is a course on archery.  </p>
<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>One of the first thoughts I have after these first two weeks is that there is so much potential and opportunity here.  It's hard to pick where to invest your time.  There are so many job/research opportunities and clubs, both for fun and for work experience.  Even the Career Center here is actually useful: I applied to internships at Facebook and Adobe with literally a click of a button.  I'm even considering rushing either Sigma Eta Pi, the entrepreneurship fraternity, or Theta Tau, the engineering fraternity.  I might even decide to double major, either in CS/Stats or CS/<a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/">Pre-Haas</a>, though we'll have to see how a single major goes first.  Oh, and the founders of Instagram came and had a Q&amp;A session on how their business started and their decision process which was pretty awesome and really informative.   </p>
<p>Even though classes haven't fully ramped up yet (and I haven't gotten a job yet), my first semester doesn't seem too bad.  CS is pretty easy and takes up very little time (especially since I don't go to lecture).  Turns out if you actually read books for class (Classics 10A), it makes the class a lot easier.  Math 54, is probably the only class I have to <em>really</em> study for, which isn't too bad.  IEOR will probably take up a lot of time, but like Software Design, I doubt it will <em>feel</em> like work.  </p>
<p>Overall, I'm <s>pretty</s> hella excited for this year.  </p>
